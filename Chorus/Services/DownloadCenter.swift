/// service it came from, and there was no way to stop one. This is the list the

/// its `Progress` and a way to cancel it, and reports how it ended. That keeps
/// WebKit out of the list's rules, so they are testable with a plain
/// `Progress`. The list lives in memory only: it is a session's record, and a
/// finished file is in Downloads whether or not the row survives a relaunch.
